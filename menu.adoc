[black big]*My Ansible network repo*

Let me  show you an example of what this would look like in production.
Here I have a repo that has some Ansible playbooks for converting CSV files into  Cisco commands.
There are some ASA firewall rules and some BGP peering commands etc..

https://github.com/colin-mccarthy/ansible_csv

I attempted to submit a pull request to make a change to one of the playbooks. The Ansible-lint Action kicked off
and eventually detected an issue and returned a failed message, the pull request did not get successfully submitted.

I received an email notification as well, letting me know it had failed.

[black big]*Setting it up*


To use the action simply create an ansible-lint.yml (or choose custom *.yml name) in the [red]#.github/workflows/# directory.













[black big]*Pre Commit hooks*

I would like to go a little deeper into linting by bringing up pre-commit hooks.

Pre-commit hooks are little scripts ran locally on your machine, that can help identify issues before submission for code review.
So when talking about the Ansible-lint action, it would really come in handy to lint the code before you submit your pull request.
This would make sure you always pass. The GitHub action would just serve as the final step that guards the shared repo.
If your using pre-commit hooks you should hypothetically never fail the gitHub action test.

To set this up on my MacBook I simply did a pip install.


[black big]*Markdown badge*

You can get a badge for your repo to show if it is passing the linting test.
